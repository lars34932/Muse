						<p class="about__paragraph"><strong>Wampum:</strong> Wampum refers to the traditional bead necklace/bracelet made from shells, which play an important role in the culture and history of Indigenous peoples in North America. Wampum was mainly crafted from the shells of the quahog and the whelk.</p>
						<p class="about__paragraph">Wampum had multiple functions. It was used as a form of currency but also served as a means to document important events and agreements. The beads were woven into belts, which often contained complex patterns and symbols representing stories and agreements.</p>
						<p class="about__paragraph"><strong>Historical Significance:</strong> European colonists quickly recognized the value of wampum and adopted it as a medium of exchange during trade with Indigenous communities. Wampum also played a crucial role in diplomatic relations and peace treaties between different tribes and between Indigenous peoples and the colonists.</p>
						<p class="about__paragraph"><strong>Cultural Value:</strong> Wampum is more than just decoration; it is a symbol of identity, heritage, and spiritual significance for Indigenous peoples. Each belt and pattern has a specific meaning and is often passed down from generation to generation as a valuable heirloom.</p>
						<p class="about__paragraph">Today, wampum is still respected and valued in Indigenous communities. It is used in ceremonies, as part of cultural events, and as a way to connect with ancestors and history.</p>
